This source code contains the iOS app and arduino sketch files. It requires 

* An iOS device
* An iOS developer account
* Two Arduinos (I used an Uno and a Mega)
* A redbear BLE shield
* A JR style transmitter module. This can be either positive PPM or negative PPM (toggleable)
* A 2S lipo to power the transmitter. 
* An RC receiver with your choice of attachments
